# antfarmkeyboard-dnd

Some info for the antfarmkeyboard D and D game!


## What are we doing?

We'll start with the one shot [Vecna: Nest of the Eldritch Eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/vnee/vecna-nest-of-the-eldritch-eye) and then kick off [Vecna: Eve of Ruin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/veor).

We'll use [DND Beyond](dndbeyond.com) for character sheets, and [roll20](roll20.net) for virtual table top.

Tentatively scheduled for Saturday nights, 8:30-11:30 eastern, starting July 6 2024

Roll20 and DND Beyond campaign links are pinned in the [discord chat](https://discord.com/channels/84498636884422656/1258178522598608956).

## What do I need to do?

For the one shot, create a level 3 character.  No strong opinions or restrictions on available content for character creation; let me know if there's something funky you're interested in trying.

The adventure takes place in [Neverwinter](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neverwinter), on the Sword Coast.  You've been hired by Lord Protector Dagult Neverember to help patrol the city.


After the one shot, we'll bump to level 10 for the campaign proper.


Further bulletins as events warrant!
